WebAssembly is a new assembly language close to metal which is shared all types of major browsers. 

It started as an upgrade to javascript, which is the only programming language on the web browser to be compiled on native level. However, all programming languages now try to support it to be compiled in the assembly language so that they can be compiled to the web without using javascript.

Rust is one of them but has more advantages than other languages with its memory-safe compiler without garbage collection. Compiled wasm from Rust has less wasm code and memory-safe on development.
